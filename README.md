This extends the fractal cli setup project with a few more batteries included:

- Webpack 4 + Webpack Middleware
- Css injection
- Js reloading through Browsersync (impossible to do through the webpack dev server?)
- Proxy setup through http-proxy-middleware
- SVG Sprite (webpack-svg-icon-system)
- Scss
- Fractal Export
- A few Handlebar helpers, you can add your own

Everything must be in the /dist directory in order to be served.

Fractal is a tool to help you **build** and **document** web component libraries and design systems.

## Introduction

Component (or pattern) libraries are a way of designing and building websites in a modular fashion, breaking up the UI into small, reusable chunks that can then later be assembled in a variety of ways to build anything from larger components right up to whole pages.

Fractal helps you assemble, preview and document website component libraries, or even scale up to document entire design systems for your organisation.

Check out the [documentation][docs] for more information.
